    <p>
        When it comes to developing code for any purpose, it can be narrowed down to simple trial and error 
        with your coding, but for more efficient coding, you're going to want a certain method of development 
        that is going to suit your current situation, each method has its own weaknesses and benefits towards 
        the project you're working on and your environment.
    </p>

    <h2>Development methods</h2>
    <p>
        The method in which you develop your code is going to come down to what situation you're in and the 
        resources you have to work with. Out of the several methods that you can apply towards your development 
        there a few set and stone ones that are the most important to be familiar with, those being
        <div class="development-methods">
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#speed">Rapid Development</a></li>             
            <li><a href="#cat">Agile Development</a></li>      
            <li><a href="#splosh">Waterfall Development</a></li>           
        </ul>
    </div>
    </p>
    <p> 
        There are obviously more specific methods of programming but generally they tend to be loosely based around
        one of these 3, as these are essentially The Big 3 methods that you're likely to make use of once in your life

    <h3 id="cat">Agile Development</h3>
    <div class="development_imgs">

    </div>
     <p>
        Agile development is the method where your development is done in several stages, with intense collaboration
        between your users in each stage, constantly changing and adapting your plans after. there are 4 main values 
        towards agile development, which are:
        <div class="steps">
        <ol>
            <li>Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools</li>
            <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
            <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
            <li>Responding to change over plan</li>
        </ol>
    </div>      
    </p>
    <p>
        This method of development is most likely used for game development, where the developers recieve feedback from
        alpha players and their own play testers, allowing for constant changes to mechanics and features that affect
        the user's overall experience, which also makes sure that the final product is more likely to be better tailored
        towards the intended users  </p>

    <h3 id="speed">Rapid Development</h3>
    <div class="development_imgs">
    <img src="rapidapplicationdevelopment-small-removebg-preview.png" alt="pattern of rapid development">
    </div>
    <p>
        Rapid Development is where you quickly create prototypes and getting as much feedback as fast as possible 
        over multiple periods where you can improve upon your code, until you can finally reach a final version 
        that is much higher in quality than the previous versions.
        <div class="steps">
        <ol>
            <li>Plan Requirements</li>
            <li>User Design</li>
            <li>Rapid Prototyping</li>
            <li>Feedback and Transition</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Rapid development ensures the fastest development time possible with your team, as you're constantly updating the
        code throughout the development process, working on every aspect of the code simultaneously, the danger with this is 
        that you have a higher chance of running into bugs and errors as the quicker development time is directly linked towards
        and increased possible chance of bugs and errors, which may reduce the overall positive experience for a new user, which
        in turn reduces your overall usercount down the line

    <h3 id="splosh">Waterfall Development</h3>
    <div class="development_imgs">
    <img src="waterfall-development-removebg-preview.png" alt="pattern of waterfall based development">
    </div>
    <p>
        Waterfall development is when you break down each task into a linear sequence of work, working on one aspect of the code at a time,
        with each subsequent phase continuing depending on the results of the last phase, this works well with smaller teams of development,
        and works better to allow for safer and more effective code.
        <div class="steps">
        <ol>
            <li>Requirements</li>
            <li>Analysis</li>
            <li>Design</li>
            <li>Coding</li>
            <li>Testing</li>
            <li>Deployment</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        With waterfall development, having the ability to work on each section individually allows for you to ensure the best and most
        efficient code, as each subsequent section of the code is directly linked towards the last, and is written according to the last
        section of the code, which reduces your overall chances of running into errors, and bugs, the only significant drawback towards this 
        is the significantly increased time of production, as you'd be working on each section one at a time, and that directly increases
        the cost of production, and increases the amount of money you'd need to mak from your software in order to rake in a profit.
